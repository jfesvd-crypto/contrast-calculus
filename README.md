# Contrast Calculus

[![Python tests](https://github.com/jfesvd-crypto/contrast-calculus/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jfesvd-crypto/contrast-calculus/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml)

A high-performance computational framework for braided fusion categories and TQFT applications.

## Overview

*Contrast Calculus* is a Python library for computing with braided fusion categories, featuring categorical coherence checks (pentagon, hexagon), Yang-Baxter solver, and optimizations like GPU acceleration. It supports applications in Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) and simulations of topological quantum computation.

## Installation

You can install `contrast-calculus` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install contrast-calculus
